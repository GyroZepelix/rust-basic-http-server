# Contributing to My Custom Rust HTTP Server

First off, thank you for considering contributing to My Custom Rust HTTP Server! It's people like you that make the open source community such a great place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make will be deeply appreciated.

## Getting started

Contributions should be made via GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by me. Here is a simple outline of the contribution process:

1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
3. **Commit** changes to your own branch
4. **Push** your work back up to your fork
5. Submit a **Pull Request** so that I can review your changes

**NOTE**: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!

## How to report a bug

If you find a bug in the source code, you can help me by submitting an issue to our GitHub Repository. Even better, you can submit a Pull Request with a fix.

**Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code.**

Here's an example:

> Short and descriptive example bug report title
>
> A summary of the issue and the browser/OS environment in which it occurs. If suitable, include the steps to reproduce the bug.
>
> 1. This is the first step
> 2. This is the second step
> 3. Further steps, etc.
>
> `<url>` - a link to the reduced test case
>
> Any other information you want to share that is relevant to the issue being reported. This might include the lines of code that you have identified as causing the bug, and potential solutions (and your opinions on their merits).

## Feature Requests

I welcome feature requests, but take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to *you* to make a strong case to convince me of the merits of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
- Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme I use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
